* NixOS configuration
Welcome to my personal infrastructure repository. This is a fully declarative, reproducible system configuration powered by *NixOS* and *Nix Flakes*.

* Secrets Management
You might notice files containing ~-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----~.
These are **NOT** private keys. They are encrypted ciphertext.

This repository uses [[https://github.com/getsops/sops][SOPS]] with [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/age][age]] encryption to manage secrets securely via GitOps practices.
- *~.sops.yaml~*: sops configuration file. It defines the creation rules and maps files to the public keys used for encryption. It contains no secret data itself.
- *~secrets.yaml~*: Contains the actual secrets encrypted with AES256_GCM. Decryption requires a specific private key stored offline (not in this repo).

* Repository Structure
This configuration targets multiple operating systems using a unified flake.

** Hosts
- *NixOS (`nixos-rog`)*: Main Linux workstation. Config in `hosts/nixos`.
- *macOS (`macos`)*: MacBook environment managed by `nix-darwin`. Config in `hosts/macos`.
  - Integrates with Homebrew for GUI apps and casks.
  - Usage: `update` alias (runs `nix-darwin switch`).

** Home Manager
User configuration is split to maximize code reuse:
- *`home/shared.nix`*: Core packages, dotfiles, and shell config shared across all systems.
- *`home/nixos/`*: Linux-specific settings (Gnome, media players, unfree packages).
- *`home/macos/`*: macOS-specific hacks, aliases, and dependencies.

* Workflow
** macOS
